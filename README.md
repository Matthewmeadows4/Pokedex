# Professor Matthew's Pokedex!
Have you ever wanted to know the typing of a specific pokemon, instantly? 
Now you can! All you have to do is type in the Pokemon you want to learn about, submit, and there you have it! 

The three requirements I wanted to implement are as follows:
1. Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it. This happens in the Pokemon search input.
2. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. I utilized PokeAPI for this.
3. Implement modern interactive UI features. As the user types in the input box, a list of possible searches appears.


This project was made for my coding bootcamp, Code Louisville.
Thanks to pokeAPI for making an amaziing api that i used for this project!
